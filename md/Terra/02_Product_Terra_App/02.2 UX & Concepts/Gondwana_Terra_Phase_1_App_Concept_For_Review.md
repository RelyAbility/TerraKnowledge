# Gondwana / Terra App Concept -- Phase 1 Proposal (For Review)

This document outlines the proposed Phase 1 concept for the Gondwana
(Terra) app, focused on delivering satellite-based ecological
intelligence across the 10 km flagship zone. This version is designed
for discussion, refinement, and feedback with Emergent.

## 1. Purpose of Phase 1

Phase 1 establishes a satellite-driven ecological baseline across the 10
km flagship zone. The objective is to provide structured, evidence-based
vegetation and habitat intelligence to support bushcare mobilisation and
future functional validation.

## 2. Core MVP Features (Satellite-Led)

• Monthly Vegetation Health Composite (Sentinel-2 NDVI/EVI)

• Vegetation Stress & Recovery Mapping

• Structural Complexity Proxy (NDVI variance + Sentinel-1 radar)

• Disturbance Monitoring (fire, clearing detection via VIIRS/Landsat)

• Connectivity & Corridor Gap Identification

• Seasonal Comparison (12-month rolling view)

## 3. User Interface Structure

• Zone Overview Map -- flagship 10 km ecological intelligence view

• Monthly Ecological Intelligence Brief (auto-generated summary)

• Hotspot Identification Layer (areas requiring attention)

• Mission Suggestions Linked to Structural Gaps

• Trend Graphs (monthly and annual)

## 4. Mission Framework -- Structural Interventions

• Mid-storey Infill Planting (support insectivorous guilds)

• Edge Buffer Enhancement (reduce fragmentation effects)

• Understorey Density Restoration

• Weed Suppression in Identified Stress Zones

• Corridor Gap Reconnection Activities

Note: Phase 1 focuses on structural optimisation. Functional validation
through expanded acoustic monitoring will be considered in Phase 2.

## 5. Phase 1 Success Metrics

• Satellite baseline completed for 10 km zone

• Monthly composite automation functioning

• 3--5 targeted structural missions initiated

• Clear ecological intelligence briefs delivered

• Stakeholder engagement (bushcare, catchment groups) active

## 6. Feedback Requested

• Clarity and usefulness of satellite intelligence outputs

• Appropriateness of mission framework

• Interface usability and structure

• Data processing workflow feasibility

• Prioritisation of additional features
