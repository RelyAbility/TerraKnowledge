# Habitat Health Index (HHI) Technical Architecture v1.0

## 1. Pillar Structure

HHI is composed of five core pillars:

1\. Ecological Function (dominant pillar: guild persistence, seasonal
continuity, volatility suppression).

2\. Habitat Structure (vegetation complexity, canopy layering, habitat
heterogeneity).

3\. Connectivity (landscape linkage, corridor continuity, fragmentation
metrics).

4\. Disturbance & Recovery (fire, clearing, hydrological disruption,
recovery trajectory).

5\. Stability & Resilience (trend durability, climate-adjusted
persistence).

## 2. Tiered Resolution Model

Tier 1 -- Satellite-derived baseline (NDVI, land cover, disturbance
history).

Tier 2 -- Acoustic-enhanced (guild persistence, seasonal stability;
minimum for credit eligibility).

Tier 3 -- Structural & functional validation (drone, LiDAR, eDNA,
hydrology, microclimate).

Resolution increases confidence, not score inflation.

## 3. Confidence Framework

Each HHI score includes a confidence band based on:

• Sensor density per km²

• Temporal depth of dataset

• Spatial coverage completeness

• Cross-data validation diversity

## 4. Elite Classification Requirements

Elite classification requires:

• Minimum acoustic sensor density threshold

• High statistical confidence band

• Sustained multi-season functional stability

• No reversal indicators

Elite is open and uncapped but evidence-gated.

## 5. Threshold Governance

Issuance thresholds require:

• Directional improvement above calibrated level

• Sustained performance across defined seasonal cycles

• Portfolio-level aggregation

• Hybrid structure: global integrity floor + regional calibration +
portfolio-relative improvement
