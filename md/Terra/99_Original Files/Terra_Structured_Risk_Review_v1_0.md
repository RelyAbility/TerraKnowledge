# Terra -- Structured Risk Review v1.0

Purpose: Identify major categories of technical, ecological,
operational, market, and governance risks for Terra Phase 1--3
evolution.

## 1. Technical Risks

• Cloud-heavy months reducing valid pixel coverage.

• Performance bottlenecks in raster processing.

• Offline sync conflicts or data loss.

• API version drift during rapid iteration.

Mitigation: QA thresholds, parallel processing, conflict resolution
logic, strict API versioning.

## 2. Ecological Risks

• Structural proxies misinterpreted as functional proof.

• Incorrect species recommendations by ecosystem mapping.

• NDVI anomalies caused by non-ecological factors.

Mitigation: Clear Tier labelling, advisory partners, disturbance tagging
context.

## 3. Engagement & Adoption Risks

• Bushcare fatigue or low mission completion.

• Low sensor density delaying Phase 2.

Mitigation: Mission gamification (non-market), sponsor clustering,
flagship concentration strategy.

## 4. Governance & Market Risks

• Regulatory scrutiny of methodology.

• Misalignment with Nature Repair Market expectations.

• Premature activation of Elite claims.

Mitigation: Dormant threshold engine, external validation workflow,
method version control.

## 5. Strategic Risks

• Expanding geographically before density achieved.

• Adding features that dilute focus from flagship.

Mitigation: 10 km concentration discipline; phased release governance.

## 6. Residual Risk Assessment

Residual risk remains moderate in ecological interpretation and market
activation stages. Technical architecture risk is reduced significantly
by current documentation depth.
