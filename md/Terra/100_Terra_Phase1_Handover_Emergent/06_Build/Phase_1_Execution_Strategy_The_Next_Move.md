# 🎯 The Next Move: Build Density Before Polish

## Core Strategy

You do not need more features right now.

You need:
- **10–15 real properties lit up with satellite activation inside 4.2 km**

That changes everything.

---

## Phase 1 Scope (Frozen)

**The Entire Product:**
- Property claim
- Satellite NDVI baseline + 3-year delta
- Stripe trial auto-start
- Satellite activation icon appears
- Expired = Monitoring paused (faded)

That's the whole product.

If that works cleanly, you're live.

---

## Step 1: Immediate — Freeze Phase 1 Scope

No new sensing layers.  
No expansion.  
No design perfection.

---

## Step 2: Soft Launch the Founding 50 (Quietly)

Do not announce publicly yet.

**Hand-pick:**
- 10–15 landholders
- 2–3 respected Land for Wildlife members
- 1–2 visible community stewards

**Execute:**
- Personally onboard them
- Help them claim
- Turn on satellite
- Ensure icon lights up

Now the map isn't empty.

---

## Step 3: Test Conversion Mechanics

Before scale, validate:
- Does trial auto-start?
- Does Stripe work cleanly?
- Does the satellite icon appear instantly?
- What happens when trial ends?

This is where many platforms quietly break.

---

## Step 4: Meet the Coordinator on 1 March With This

Not a pitch deck.

Show them:
> "Here are 12 properties already being tracked from space."

That is infinitely more powerful than describing vision.

---

## What NOT To Do Right Now

Don't:
- Add soil
- Add DNA
- Expand radius
- Build acoustic integration
- Tweak colour schemes endlessly

You're in the ignition phase, not the expansion phase.

---

## The Strategic Milestone

Your real short-term goal is:  
**25 satellite icons inside 4.2 km**

Once that happens:
- Curiosity spreads
- Coordinators see seriousness
- Founding 50 fills faster
- Stripe conversion becomes measurable
- The map feels alive

---

## Alignment with Terra Constitution

This strategy reinforces:
- **Article III (Constraint Principle)**: Density precedes scale; proof precedes expansion
- **Article IV (Behavioural Ladder)**: Moving from Ownership → Pride → Calm → Curiosity through visible, tangible activation
- **Article V (Structure Before Signal)**: Satellite verification as foundational, not supplementary
- **Article VI (Trust-First Design)**: Honest, simple go-to-market with real proof rather than features
- **Article VII (Corridor Identity)**: 25 icons creates visible collective progress
