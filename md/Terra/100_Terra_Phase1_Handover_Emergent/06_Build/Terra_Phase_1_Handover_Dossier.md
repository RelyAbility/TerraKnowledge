# Terra Ecological Operating System (EOS v1)

## Phase 1 -- Handover Dossier

Date: 16 February 2026

Landscape: Brookfield (4.2 km Ecological Boundary)

Prepared for: Emergent

## 1. Executive Intent

This dossier formally initiates the build of Terra Phase 1 --- the first
activated landscape of the Terra Ecological Operating System (EOS).
Brookfield serves as the symbolic birthplace of the Terra model. The
objective is to implement a landscape-first coordination system based on
a 1 km × 1 km performance grid within a 4.2 km ecological boundary.

This is not the development of a conventional mobile application. It is
the implementation of a repeatable, version-controlled ecological
coordination layer.

## 2. Foundational Design Decisions (Non-Negotiable)

- Landscape-first architecture (1 km grid is the primary unit).

- 4.2 km ecological boundary centred on 81 Boscombe Road, Brookfield.

- Edge-only adjacency logic (no corner-touch adjacency).

- Public grid performance map; private property boundaries.

- BPPF_v1.0 scoring logic with strict version control.

- Append-only data model for score runs, missions, and event logs.

- Transparent methodology and visible confidence scoring.

## 3. Scope of Phase 1

- Implement 1 km deterministic grid within boundary.

- Deploy BPPF_v1.0 scoring engine (Priority Index 0--100).

- Establish mission engine with verification pathways.

- Enable cluster detection and corridor activation mechanics.

- Deploy React Native mobile application (grid-first UX).

- Launch public landscape map with methodology transparency.

- Pack 7 -- Deployment & Rollout Strategy

- Pack 7B -- Movement Launch Strategy

- Technical Implementation Brief

- Delivery Milestone Plan

## 5. Delivery Philosophy

Terra Phase 1 will be built through structured co-design. Architectural
principles are fixed; implementation refinements are expected during
development. All refinements must strengthen Terra as a landscape
coordination operating system.

Architecture freeze points will occur at the conclusion of each
milestone phase to ensure version control and prevent scope drift.

## 6. Definition of Phase 1 Success

- Publicly accessible Brookfield landscape grid.

- At least one activated ecological corridor.

- Operational mission lifecycle with verified uplift.

- Functioning cluster detection and Collective Uplift Index.

- Transparent methodology and scoring logic published.

## 7. Closing Statement

Brookfield is the founding landscape of Terra. The systems implemented
here must be replicable, auditable, and capable of scaling to additional
landscapes without architectural redesign. Every implementation decision
should reinforce Terra as a durable ecological coordination model.
