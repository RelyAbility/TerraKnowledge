# Terra Ecological Operating System (EOS v1)

## Delivery Milestone Plan

Date: 16 February 2026

## Phase 1 -- Infrastructure (Weeks 1--3)

- Generate 4.2 km boundary.

- Create deterministic 1 km grid.

- Implement edge-only adjacency.

- Deploy Supabase schema and spatial indexing.

Deliverable: Working grid visible in staging environment.

## Phase 2 -- Scoring Engine (Weeks 4--6)

- Implement BPPF_v1.0 scoring logic.

- Enable Score_Run versioning and logging.

- Generate Explain payload per grid.

- Render tiers and Priority Index in app.

Deliverable: Live grid with tier classifications.

## Phase 3 -- Mission Engine (Weeks 7--9)

- Seed mission library (12--20 missions).

- Implement mission eligibility engine.

- Enable mission lifecycle (start → complete → verify).

- Integrate score delta recalculation pathway.

Deliverable: Functional mission flow with evidence submission.

## Phase 4 -- Network Effects (Weeks 10--12)

- Implement cluster detection algorithm.

- Enable cluster state transitions.

- Calculate Collective Uplift Index.

- Activate corridor completion mechanic.

Deliverable: Visible cluster activation mechanics in app.

## Phase 5 -- Public Map Launch (Weeks 13--14)

- Enable public access mode (no login required).

- Publish methodology and version transparency page.

- Verify privacy controls.

- Prepare first corridor activation communication.

Deliverable: Publicly accessible Brookfield landscape map.

## Success Criteria

- ≥10 claimed properties.

- ≥1 corridor cluster activated.

- ≥20 missions started.

- ≥10 verified uplift events.

- ≥1 grid tier transition.
