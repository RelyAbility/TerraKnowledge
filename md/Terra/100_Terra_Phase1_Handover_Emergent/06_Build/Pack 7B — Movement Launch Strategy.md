**Pack 7B --- Movement Launch Strategy**

**Terra EOS v1 --- Brookfield as the First Activated Landscape**

**1) The Framing**

You are not launching:

- An app

- A biodiversity tool

- A restoration dashboard

You are launching:

The first activated 1 km landscape grid in Australia.

That language matters.

**2) What Movement Positioning Requires**

If this is visible:

1.  The grid-first concept must feel bold, not technical.

2.  Corridor activation must feel inevitable.

3.  Landholders must feel like founding members, not beta testers.

4.  The 4.2 km boundary must feel intentional and ecological.

You are introducing a new mental model:

"Land doesn't improve alone. It improves in coordinated grid cells."

That's different.

**3) Movement Architecture (Phase 1 Public Narrative)**

**Core Message**

Terra coordinates landholders across a shared 1 km ecological grid to
restore corridors and activate landscapes.

Not:

- "Download the app."

- "Check your score."

**Public Concepts**

Introduce three visible ideas:

1.  **Performance Units**\
    Each 1 km grid is a measurable ecological unit.

2.  **Activated Corridors**\
    When adjacent grids act, the landscape shifts.

3.  **Strategic Nodes**\
    When clusters activate, the ecosystem stabilises.

These are simple but powerful.

**4) Launch Sequence (Movement-Oriented)**

**Phase 1 --- Founding Grid Reveal**

Publicly show:

- The 4.2 km boundary

- The grid overlay

- The first few activated grids

Visual simplicity:

- Clean heatmap

- Minimal technical detail

The grid-first visual becomes the brand.

**Phase 2 --- First Corridor Activation Event**

This is your headline moment:

"Brookfield Corridor Activated."

It doesn't need to be large.

It needs to be symbolic.

Even 3 contiguous verified grids is enough.

Document it.\
Share it.\
Frame it as:

The first landscape activation event.

**Phase 3 --- Strategic Node Target**

Public goal:

"5 grids to Strategic Node."

This creates shared momentum.

**5) Behavioural Design for a Movement**

If it's visible, you must strengthen:

- Reputation layer

- Cluster progress visibility

- Invitation loop

Add to UI (minor but important):

- Subtle public badge:

  - "Founding Grid Contributor"

  - "Corridor Builder"

Not gamified. Honour-based.

People join movements when they see early builders.

**6) Media & Credibility Layer**

Because this is visible, you must control narrative.

Messaging pillars:

- Transparent scoring

- Edge-only corridor logic

- No regulatory reporting

- Audit-ready model

- Ecological boundary justification

Prepare:

- 1-page visual explainer

- 3 graphics (grid, corridor, activation)

- Clear FAQ

You want:\
Curiosity → Understanding → Participation.

Not confusion.

**7) Risk Shift (Movement Mode)**

Going visible increases risk:

1.  Public scrutiny of scoring

2.  Questions about ecological legitimacy

3.  Sensitivity around land ownership

Mitigation:

- Always publish model version

- Always show confidence

- Always emphasise voluntary participation

- Keep property boundaries private

Transparency is your shield.

**8) What Success Looks Like in Movement Mode**

Within 90 days:

- 1 Activated Corridor

- 1 Strategic Node in progress

- 15--25 claimed properties

- Visible cluster map shared publicly

- At least 1 external observer (academic/landcare) referencing the
  activation

That's momentum.

**9) The Psychological Shift for You**

You are no longer:

Testing an ecological model.

You are:

Introducing a new coordination layer for landscapes.

That's a bigger ambition.

And it changes how tightly the product, messaging, and rollout must
align.
