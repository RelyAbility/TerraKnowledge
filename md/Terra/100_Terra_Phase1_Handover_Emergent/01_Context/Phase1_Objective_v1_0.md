**Terra -- Gondwana BioReserve**\
**Phase 1: Satellite-Driven Ecological Intelligence MVP**

**1. Purpose**

Phase 1 establishes a minimum viable ecological intelligence platform
capable of:

- Measuring vegetation condition using satellite data

- Mapping Regional Ecosystem (RE) types within a defined 4.2 km radius

- Generating a transparent vegetation health score

- Estimating a biodiversity uplift proxy based on vegetation trend

- Delivering monthly ecological intelligence via a mobile interface

Phase 1 is designed to prove that biodiversity-relevant ecological
signal can be measured continuously and cost-effectively using remote
sensing.

**2. Geographic Scope**

**Pilot Area:**\
4.2 km radius centred on\
**81 Boscombe Road, Brookfield, QLD**

**Regional Ecosystems within scope include (non-exhaustive):**

- 12.11.5

- 12.11.3a

- 12.12.12

- 12.3.11

- 12.11.3

- 12.3.16

Phase 1 focuses on vegetation condition within these ecosystems as the
primary biodiversity proxy.

**3. Core Hypothesis**

If vegetation condition improves within a defined Regional Ecosystem
context,\
then biodiversity potential increases.

Phase 1 tests whether:

1.  NDVI-based vegetation metrics can reliably track structural
    condition.

2.  Ecosystem-specific baselines can be established.

3.  Vegetation trend over time can serve as a defensible biodiversity
    uplift proxy.

4.  A landholder-facing dashboard can communicate this clearly.

**4. Phase 1 Deliverables**

**4.1 Platform Capabilities**

- Satellite ingestion pipeline (Sentinel-2 primary)

- Monthly NDVI composite generation

- Plot-level RE classification

- Vegetation health scoring engine

- Biodiversity uplift proxy model

- Confidence level indicator (basic tier logic)

- Mobile interface (React Native)

- Offline brief caching

- Push notification capability (Monthly Brief)

**4.2 Landholder Outputs**

For each registered plot:

- Ecosystem classification

- Vegetation health score (scaled index)

- Trend indicator (Improving / Stable / Declining)

- Structural complexity proxy

- Suggested structural missions

- Tier transparency (Tier 1 structural only)

**5. Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 1)**

To maintain delivery discipline, Phase 1 does NOT include:

- Acoustic-based species validation (Tier 2 activation)

- Biodiversity credit issuance

- Carbon accounting

- Elite classification workflows

- Insurance integration

- External certification (NaturePlus / BAI alignment)

- Portfolio aggregation for market issuance

- Advanced economic modelling

These are reserved for Phase 2+.

**6. Success Criteria**

Phase 1 is successful if:

1.  The satellite processing pipeline operates monthly without manual
    intervention.

2.  Vegetation health scores update consistently.

3.  Ecosystem overlays function accurately.

4.  Uplift proxy reflects observable vegetation change.

5.  Landholders can interpret the dashboard without expert assistance.

6.  The system scales across the full 4.2 km zone.

**7. Primary Risks**

- Seasonal NDVI distortion

- Cloud cover interference

- Misinterpretation of structural improvement

- Overstating biodiversity claims

- Data latency or pipeline instability

Mitigation:

- Seasonal normalisation

- Cloud masking and composite smoothing

- Conservative uplift logic

- Transparent Tier 1 labelling

- Clear method version tracking

**8. Outcome of Phase 1**

By completion, Terra will demonstrate:

- Continuous ecological monitoring capability

- Landscape-scale satellite intelligence

- A defensible structural uplift proxy

- A scalable technical foundation for functional biodiversity validation
  (Phase 2)

Phase 1 proves ecological signal.

It does not claim full biodiversity restoration.
