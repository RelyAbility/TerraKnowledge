# Habitat Health Index (HHI) -- Executive Summary

HHI is a universal biodiversity performance index measuring ecological
function across restoration and conserved landscapes.

## Core Features

• Function-first composite index

• Tiered resolution model (satellite → acoustic → structural validation)

• Proprietary but auditable methodology

• Portfolio-scale assessment

• Evidence-gated elite classification

## Why It Matters

HHI provides statistically defensible, outcome-based biodiversity
measurement suitable for regulators, NRMs, councils, and biodiversity
markets.

Elite classification represents investment-grade ecological performance
requiring high sensor density and sustained functional stability.
