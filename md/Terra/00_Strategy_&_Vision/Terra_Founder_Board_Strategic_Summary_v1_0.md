# Terra -- Founder & Board Strategic Summary v1.0

Purpose: Provide a high-level strategic overview of Terra's
architecture, network effects, phased evolution, and risk posture for
leadership and board review.

## 1. What Terra Is

Terra is a mobile-first biodiversity intelligence platform designed to
evolve from satellite-led structural monitoring (Phase 1) into a
portfolio-scale, function-validated biodiversity infrastructure aligned
with HHI governance.

## 2. Strategic Architecture

• Phase 1: Structural intelligence via satellite composites (NDVI,
heterogeneity, disturbance).

• Phase 2: Functional validation via acoustic density integration.

• Phase 3: Portfolio scoring, Elite eligibility, and external
validation.

• Tiered confidence model prevents overclaiming ecological outcomes.

• All outputs versioned and reproducible for regulatory defensibility.

## 3. Network Effects (Flywheel)

• Geographic concentration (4.2 km flagship) builds density.

• Density improves confidence and credibility.

• Credibility attracts sponsors and partners.

• Sponsors fund increased sensor density and mission activation.

• Density + time-series depth enable Elite pathway readiness.

## 4. Competitive Advantage

• Explicit tier separation (structural vs functional).

• Confidence scoring embedded from Phase 1.

• Governance-ready architecture (method versioning + audit trail).

• Portfolio aggregation from day one.

• Clear pathway to Elite classification and future market activation.

## 5. Key Risks & Mitigations

• Risk: Overclaiming ecological outcomes. Mitigation: Strict Tier
enforcement.

• Risk: Low engagement in early stages. Mitigation: Mission-driven
activation model.

• Risk: Architectural rework later. Mitigation: Phase scaffolding
embedded now.

• Risk: Regulatory scrutiny. Mitigation: Versioning + reproducibility
controls.

## 6. Phase 1 Success Definition

• Monthly composites operational and reproducible.

• Mission engine active and adopted by local groups.

• Confidence object functioning and transparent.

• Offline + notification mobile experience stable.

• Architecture verified as Phase 2 compatible.
