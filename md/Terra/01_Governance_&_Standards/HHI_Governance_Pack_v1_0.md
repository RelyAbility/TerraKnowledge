# Habitat Health Index (HHI) Governance Pack v1.0

This consolidated governance pack contains the foundational doctrine,
technical architecture, regulatory alignment, structural framework, and
conceptual scoring model for the Habitat Health Index (HHI).

## Section 1: Constitution

• Purpose: HHI is a universal biodiversity performance index measuring
ecological function across restoration and conserved landscapes.

• Core Philosophy: Outcome-based, function-first, tiered-resolution,
proprietary but auditable, threshold-governed, evidence-gated at elite
levels.

• Ecological Function is the dominant pillar.

• HHI is a composite score with embedded guardrails.

• Tiered Model: Tier 1 (Satellite), Tier 2 (Acoustic -- minimum for
credits), Tier 3 (Structural validation).

• Higher resolution increases confidence, not score inflation.

• Elite classification requires density, statistical confidence, and
sustained functional stability.

• Threshold-based issuance model adopted.

• Hybrid threshold structure: global floor + regional calibration +
portfolio-relative improvement.

• Version control required for all structural changes.

## Section 2: Technical Architecture

Five Core Pillars:

1\. Ecological Function (dominant) -- guild persistence, seasonal
continuity, volatility suppression.

2\. Habitat Structure -- canopy layering, understorey density, habitat
heterogeneity.

3\. Connectivity -- corridor continuity, fragmentation reduction.

4\. Disturbance & Recovery -- fire, clearing, recovery trajectory.

5\. Stability & Resilience -- multi-year durability and climate-adjusted
persistence.

Confidence determined by sensor density, temporal depth, spatial
coverage, and data diversity.

## Section 3: Nature Repair Market Alignment

• Portfolio-scale assessment is the unit of credit issuance.

• Guild-level metrics form the basis of outcome calculation.

• Species-level metrics excluded from credit calculation to reduce
noise.

• Dynamic baselines with seasonal normalisation applied.

• Real-time reversal detection embedded in monitoring framework.

• Tier 2 acoustic enhancement minimum for credit eligibility.

## Section 4: HHI Score Bands

• 0--49: Degraded

• 50--64: Recovering

• 65--74: Functionally Established

• 75--84: High Performance (Tier 2 required)

• 85--100: Elite (Density + Confidence + Multi-season stability
required)

## Section 5: Elite Classification Framework

• Functional threshold met (sustained guild persistence & volatility
suppression).

• Minimum acoustic density threshold achieved.

• High statistical confidence band achieved.

• No material reversal indicators present.

• Elite is open (not capped) but evidence-gated.
