# Habitat Health Index (HHI) -- Structural Addendum v1.0

This addendum formalises HHI score bands, elite classification
requirements, and the core system architecture in a concise governance
format.

## 1. HHI Score Bands (Conceptual)

0--49 \| Degraded: Functional instability, high volatility, structural
limitation.

50--64 \| Recovering: Structural gains emerging; functional signals
inconsistent.

65--74 \| Functionally Established: Multi-season guild persistence;
reduced volatility.

75--84 \| High Performance: Sustained functional continuity; strong
seasonal stability; Tier 2 required.

85--100 \| Elite: Landscape-scale ecological function; multi-year
persistence; density + confidence thresholds required.

Elite classification is open (not capped) but evidence-gated through
density, confidence, and sustained ecological function.

## 2. Elite Classification Framework

A\) Functional Threshold -- Sustained guild persistence; volatility
suppression; multi-season continuity.

B\) Density Threshold -- Minimum acoustic sensors per km²
(bioregion-adjusted) with spatial coverage integrity.

C\) Statistical Confidence Threshold -- Confidence band within defined
uncertainty range; sufficient time-series depth.

D\) Reversal Guardrail -- No material degradation signals or structural
collapse indicators.
