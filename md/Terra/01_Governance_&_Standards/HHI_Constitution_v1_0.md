# Habitat Health Index (HHI) Constitution v1.0

This document formalises the foundational doctrine, structural
principles, and governance decisions underpinning the Habitat Health
Index (HHI).

## 1. Purpose

The Habitat Health Index (HHI) is a universal biodiversity performance
index designed to measure, compare, and verify ecological function
across landscapes.

HHI applies to:

• Restoration landscapes

• Conserved landscapes

• Pristine ecosystems

• Mixed-use peri-urban environments

HHI measures ecological performance --- not effort.

## 2. Core Philosophy

HHI is:

• Outcome-based

• Function-first

• Portfolio-capable

• Tiered-resolution

• Proprietary but auditable

• Threshold-governed

• Evidence-gated at elite levels

HHI is not:

• A vegetation proxy index

• A species-count metric

• A gamified conservation score

• A credit-maximisation tool

## 3. Structural Principles

### 3.1 Ecological Function Dominance

Ecological function (guild persistence, seasonal continuity, volatility
suppression) is the largest single pillar within HHI.

Structure enables function. Function validates structure.

### 3.2 Composite Integrity

HHI is a single composite score. Ecological function is embedded within
HHI, not external to it. Minimum pillar thresholds may apply for
issuance or elite classification.

### 3.3 Tiered Resolution Model

Tier 1 --- Satellite-derived baseline

Tier 2 --- Acoustic-enhanced (minimum for credit eligibility)

Tier 3 --- Structural & functional validation (drone, eDNA, hydrology,
etc.)

Higher resolution increases confidence, not score inflation.

### 3.4 Confidence Principle

Every HHI score must include a confidence band. Confidence increases
with sensor density, time-series depth, spatial coverage, and data
diversity.

### 3.5 Elite Evidence Gate

Elite classification requires minimum acoustic density, statistical
confidence, sustained multi-season functional stability, and no reversal
indicators.

Elite is open to all who meet criteria. Elite is never quota-limited.

### 3.6 Threshold Governance

Credit issuance requires directional improvement, sustained duration,
functional stability, confidence threshold, and portfolio-level
assessment.

### 3.7 Universality

HHI applies equally to repair (improvement trajectory) and maintenance
(protection trajectory). Pristine ecosystems are measured for sustained
function, not improvement.

### 3.8 Version Control

HHI must be versioned. All structural changes must be documented. No
threshold relaxation without formal review.

## 4. Formalised Strategic Decisions

HHI-001: HHI will be a universal biodiversity performance index.

HHI-002: HHI will be proprietary but auditable.

HHI-003: HHI will be a composite score.

HHI-004: Ecological function will be the dominant pillar (approx.
35--45%).

HHI-005: Ecological function will not sit outside HHI as a parallel
gate.

HHI-006: Elite classification requires both sensor density and
statistical confidence.

HHI-007: Elite category will not be capped regionally.

HHI-008: Tier 2 (acoustic-enhanced) minimum required for credit
issuance.

HHI-009: Higher resolution increases confidence, not score inflation.

HHI-010: Threshold-based issuance model adopted.

HHI-011: Hybrid threshold structure adopted (global floor + regional
calibration + portfolio improvement).
