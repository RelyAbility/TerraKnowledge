**GONDWANA BIORESERVE**

**Founding 50 Ecological Observatory**

**Governance & Participation Framework (v1.0)**

**1. Purpose**

The Founding 50 Ecological Observatory establishes the first
private-land, sensor-enabled biodiversity monitoring network within the
4.2 km Gondwana Pilot Zone.

The program:

- Is capped at 50 private properties.

- Operates under a standards-aligned biodiversity performance framework.

- Integrates satellite analysis (Terra) with acoustic biodiversity
  monitoring.

- Recognises and elevates stewardship leadership.

This document formalises eligibility, governance, accountability, and
recognition structures.

**2. Strategic Intent**

The Founding 50 is designed to:

- Create a scientifically defensible private-land biodiversity baseline.

- Incentivise stewardship through recognition, not punishment.

- Establish a permanent ecological observatory network.

- Build Terra's founding member ecosystem.

- Demonstrate measurable biodiversity performance and uplift.

**3. Scope**

- Geographic boundary: 4.2 km radius pilot zone (Brookfield region).

- Participation: Private land only.

- Network size: Strict hard cap of 50 properties.

- Monitoring system: Satellite + on-site acoustic sensor.

No expansion beyond 50 within this pilot zone.

**4. Eligibility Criteria**

To qualify, a property must:

1.  Be located within the 4.2 km pilot boundary.

2.  Register within Terra (Free version).

3.  Meet minimum biodiversity priority threshold (as defined by BPI
    scoring).

4.  Agree to the Founding 50 Stewardship Covenant.

5.  Purchase and host a Gondwana acoustic sensor.

6.  Commit to a minimum 12-month participation period.

Eligibility does not guarantee acceptance; places are limited to 50.

**5. Hard Cap Structure**

The Founding 50 is permanently limited to 50 properties.

Once all 50 places are secured:

- No additional properties may join.

- A place only becomes available if a member voluntarily withdraws or
  breaches covenant terms.

Scarcity is intentional and structural.

**6. Stewardship Covenant**

Founding Members commit to:

1.  No deliberate clearing of remnant vegetation.

2.  No intentional degradation of ecological integrity.

3.  Participation in monitoring and data collection.

4.  Maintenance of sensor uptime (reasonable effort standard).

5.  Notification of major land-use changes.

6.  Engagement in at least one ecological stewardship action annually
    (where applicable).

The covenant focuses on stewardship behaviour, not natural biodiversity
fluctuations.

**7. Governance Model**

**7.1 Founding Status**

- Founding 50 status is permanent once secured.

- Status is not revoked due to natural ecological variation.

- Removal occurs only for covenant breach or voluntary withdrawal.

**7.2 Annual Review**

Each property undergoes an annual review assessing:

- Stewardship compliance

- Habitat integrity (no net deliberate loss)

- Sensor uptime

- Participation engagement

This is a stewardship review, not a biodiversity "punishment" review.

**8. Performance & Recognition Structure**

The Founding 50 operates under a positive recognition model.

Annual recognition tiers include:

- **Gold Steward** -- Exceptional habitat integrity and/or uplift
  leadership.

- **Silver Steward** -- Stable habitat and active participation.

- **Active Steward** -- Compliant and engaged member.

- **Restoration Leader** -- Highest measurable uplift.

- **Corridor Guardian** -- Critical connectivity node.

Recognition is based on stewardship, participation, and contextualised
biodiversity metrics.

Natural environmental variation does not trigger demotion.

**9. Biodiversity Performance Framework**

Each property integrates into the Gondwana Biodiversity Priority Index
(BPI) system.

Performance dimensions include:

- Ecological Value

- Connectivity

- Conservation Sensitivity

- Uplift Potential

Sensor data contributes to:

- Acoustic richness index

- Indicator guild presence

- Habitat condition proxy

- Longitudinal trend monitoring

The objective is transparency and improvement over time.

**10. Terra Integration**

Terra Free enables:

- Property boundary registration

- Priority score visibility

- Eligibility notification for Founding 50

Eligible properties see:

"You are eligible to apply for one of the 50 Founding Observatory
Sites."

Terra displays:

- Number of secured sites (e.g., 37 of 50 secured)

- Priority zones filling first

- Founding Member recognition badges (subject to visibility settings)

**11. Visibility & Privacy**

Visibility options (to be finalised):

- Public listing with steward badge

- Anonymous participation

- Member-controlled visibility setting

Public display is optional but encouraged.

**12. Scientific Integrity Principles**

The Founding 50 network is:

- Stratified by ecological zone.

- Replicated across habitat types.

- Inclusive of control sites.

- Transparent in scoring methodology.

- Version-controlled and auditable.

It is positioned as:

A private-land ecological observatory network.

**13. Exit & Replacement Policy**

A Founding 50 slot may become available if:

- A member voluntarily withdraws.

- A covenant breach occurs.

- Sensor removal without replacement.

- Sustained non-compliance with stewardship obligations.

Vacant slots are offered to the highest-priority eligible property
within the pilot zone.

**14. Long-Term Vision**

The Founding 50 establishes:

- The pilot biodiversity observatory.

- The behavioural blueprint for expansion.

- The Terra stewardship growth engine.

- The credibility layer for future regional scaling.

Future regions may replicate the model, but each region maintains its
own capped founding cohort.

**15. Version Control**

Framework Version: 1.0\
Pilot Zone: 4.2 km Brookfield Radius\
Sensor Network Target: 50\
Date: \[Insert Date\]

Any structural changes require version increment (v1.1, v2.0, etc.).
