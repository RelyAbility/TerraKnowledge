# HHI -- Nature Repair Market Alignment Addendum

## 1. Alignment with Outcome-Based Design

HHI embeds guild-level persistence, seasonal continuity, and volatility
suppression.

Species-level metrics are excluded from credit calculation to reduce
noise and gaming risk.

## 2. Portfolio-Level Assessment

Credit issuance is based on portfolio-scale functional improvement.

High sensor density reduces leakage and displacement risk.

## 3. Dynamic Baseline Integration

Rolling historical baselines and seasonal normalisation reduce
counterfactual risk.

Real-time monitoring enables early reversal detection.

## 4. Evidence Gating for Credits

Tier 2 (acoustic-enhanced) is minimum requirement for credit
eligibility.

Elite classification requires density and statistical robustness.
