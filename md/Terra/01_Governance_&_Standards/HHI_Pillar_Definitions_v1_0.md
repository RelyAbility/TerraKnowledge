# Habitat Health Index (HHI) -- Pillar Definitions & Conceptual Scoring Logic v1.0

This document defines the five core pillars of the Habitat Health Index
(HHI) and outlines their conceptual scoring logic. Exact weightings and
fusion algorithms remain proprietary but auditable.

## 1. Ecological Function (Dominant Pillar)

Core Focus: Measured ecological use and persistence.

Primary Indicators:

• Functional guild persistence (canopy, mid-storey, ground insectivores,
nectarivores, granivores, predators)

• Seasonal continuity and return patterns

• Volatility suppression relative to baseline

Conceptual Scoring Logic:

Higher scores reflect sustained multi-season guild stability, reduced
volatility, and evidence of ecosystem function rather than episodic
species presence.

## 2. Habitat Structure

Core Focus: Physical habitat complexity and vegetative integrity.

Primary Indicators:

• Canopy layering and heterogeneity

• Understorey density

• Native vegetation cover trends

Conceptual Scoring Logic:

Higher scores reflect increased structural complexity and habitat
heterogeneity consistent with functional support of faunal guilds.

## 3. Connectivity

Core Focus: Landscape linkage and fragmentation suppression.

Primary Indicators:

• Corridor continuity metrics

• Patch isolation analysis

• Edge effect mitigation

Conceptual Scoring Logic:

Higher scores reflect improved ecological connectivity and reduced
fragmentation, supporting landscape-scale species movement.

## 4. Disturbance & Recovery

Core Focus: Disturbance frequency and recovery trajectory.

Primary Indicators:

• Fire disturbance history

• Clearing events

• Recovery rate post-disturbance

Conceptual Scoring Logic:

Higher scores reflect stable disturbance regimes and evidence of
recovery resilience without functional collapse.

## 5. Stability & Resilience

Core Focus: Durability of ecological performance over time.

Primary Indicators:

• Multi-year trend stability

• Climate-adjusted persistence signals

• Absence of reversal indicators

Conceptual Scoring Logic:

Higher scores reflect consistent ecological performance across seasonal
and climatic variability.

## Composite Score Logic (Conceptual)

HHI is calculated as a composite score integrating all five pillars.
Ecological Function is the largest single contributor. Minimum pillar
thresholds may apply for credit issuance and elite classification.

Higher data resolution increases statistical confidence but does not
inflate the composite score.
