# TerraKnowledge

This repository contains Terra project documentation in a Git-friendly format.

## Source of truth

- `md/` is the canonical, actively maintained documentation.
- `docx/` is **legacy** source material retained for reference/history.

If you’re editing or adding documentation, prefer updating/adding Markdown under `md/`.

## Repository layout

- `md/Terra/` — Primary documentation organized by domain (strategy, governance, product, data, architecture, etc.).
- `docx/Terra/` — Original/legacy Word documents (and related exports) mirroring the same high-level structure.

## Notes

- Empty directories in `md/` may contain a `.gitkeep` file so Git preserves the intended folder structure.
